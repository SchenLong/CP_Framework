# CP_Framework
A Framework to participate safely in the fight against CP. 
  - https://github.com/SchenLong/CP_Framework


# What is this?
A Framework developed in order to allow an OSINT asset to conduct CP investigation with a minimum risk exposure to law enforcement.  

# The problem
CP investigation usually conduct an asset to navigate on CP servers, download and analyze CP contents or in some cases, engaging contact and inflitrating a CP community.
CP Investigators lives with the risk to find themselves prosecuted along with the CP offenders they are investigating, facing the same sentences. This situation creates for CP investigators a context of seclusion, secrecy and untrustness along the community, the OSINT collective platforms does not wish to expose themselves to CP fight as it could compromise the platform itself, the few foundations and organizations fighting CP are under law enforcement monitoring due to a lack of juridical context, Interpol and Europol stays mostly quiet to OSINT CP investigators. There is a common point to all these issues which is the lack of collaboration with Law Enforcement.  

# The solution
To develop a Framework along with the needed documentations and processes for CP investigator to report their investigation and cover themselves through transparency and logging. CP investigator are condemend to move in the black zone, this project pretend to open a gate to the grey zone, find and build a place where CP investigators could gang up and start working as teams without the fear of the early morning knock-knock.

# External actors 
- To establish contact and receive feedback, ideally the collaboration of entities involved in CP fight.
- The participation of foundations involved in Child exploitation organism for the establishement of this framework. 
- The support from a profesional psychologist for the CP investigators (the cost of the individual sessions will be covered by **TBD** as part of its commmitement and support to the community)
- **TBD** is a cie founded to provide external Cyberservices, I am the sole legal responsible, the idea to use its base as a legal shield for CP Investigators is not discarded.  

# Implementation, structure and responsibilities
If an official structure would be required by external actors, several solutions can be reasonably envisioned.
A collective platform, A foundation, An organization or the integration of this project into a Cybersec cie (**TBD**), the structure will mainly depend of the external actors requirements in the eventuality of their cooperation on this project.

# Transparency and secrecy
- In regards to external actors the franework shall lead a CP Investigator to work in a transparent, logged and auditable way.
- In regards to CP offenders, the framework shall not provide any clues or information allowing them to upgrade their OPSEC processes.
- As a result of the above, the part of this project hosted on Github is purely documental, focusing on processes, oriented on evidences collection and reporting. 

# Current progress
- Starting the project on Github.  - In progress
- Defining the scope of this project - In progress

# Wanna Help ?
- Bring your experience and participate in the establishement of the framework.
- If you have contact of interest with CP fighting entities get in, their advises in setting reporting format and collaboration processes would be great apportation.  

# What´s now, what´s next ?
- Current work: Establishing baseline for this project
- Next step: Establishement of technical project
- Initiating contact with external actors - Pending project draft
