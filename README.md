# CP_Framework
A Framework to participate into the fight against CP. 
  - https://github.com/SchenLong/CP_Framework


# What is this?
A Framework developed in order to allow an OSINT asset to conduct CP investigation with a minimum risk exposure to law enforcement.  

# The problem
CP investigation usually conduct an asset to navigate on CP servers, download and analyze CP contents or for in most extreme case, engaging contact and inflitrating a CP community.
CP Investigators lives with the risk to find themselves prosecuted along with the CP offenders they were investigating. 
This situation creates for CP investigators a context of seclusion, secrecy and untrustness along the community, the OSINT actual platforms does not wish to expose themselves to CP fight, the few foundation and organization fighting CP are under law enforcement monitoring, Interpol and Europol stays mostly quiet to CP investigators.

# The solution
To develop a Framework along with the needed documentations and processes for CP investigator to report they investigation and cover themselves through a transparency and investigation logs.
CP investigator are condemend to move in the black zone, this project pretend to open a gate so we all can move to the grey zone together and find a place to gang up all together and start working as teams. 

# External actors and Law enforcement
To establish contact and receive feedback, ideally the participation from public forces for this project 
The participation of foundations involved in Child exploitation organism for the establishement of this framework. 

# Implementation and structure
If an official structure would be required by law enforcement several solutions can be reasonably envisioned.
A collective platform, A foundation, An organization or the integration of this project into a Cybersec cie (Black Capsu/e), the structure will mainly depend of law enforcement requirements in the eventuality of their cooperation on this project.

# Eventual requireements of responsibilites
If responsibilities are a mandatory point of law enforcement requirements for their cooperation, I would assume the legal responsibilities or the structure creation under adequatly defined conditions. 

# Current progress
- Starting the project on Github.  - In progress
- Defining the scope of this project - In progress
- Contact with French law enforcement personal - Pending answer (25/10/2018)
- Contact with French Interior Minister - Pending answer (24/10/2018)
- Contact with Interpol - In progress
- Contact with Europol - In progress
- Contact with Spanish autorithies - In progress

# Wanna Help ?
- Bring your experience and participate in the establishement of the framework.
- If you have contact of interest with law enforcement get in touch with me, their participation is more than required.  

# What´s now, what´s next ?
- Current work: Establishing baseline for this project
- Next step: Establishement of technical project

# Related, Participating, Thanks
This project is part of the #Mutaito_Hackademy and benefits from Black Capsu/e Cyberservices ressources. 
Thanks to the OSINT community for their inspiration and mere existence #Cloakless_Heroes
