A Framework to fight against online CP. 
  - https://github.com/SchenLong/CP_Framework


# What is this?
A Framework developed in order to allow an OSINT asset to conduct CP investigation with a minimum risk exposure to law enforcement.  

# The problem
CP investigation usually conduct an asset to navigate on CP servers, download and analyze CP contents or for in most extreme case, engaging contact and inflitrating a CP community.
CP Investigators lives with the risk to find themselves prosecuted along with the CP offenders they were investigating. 
This situation creates for CP investigators a context of seclusion, secrecy and untrustness along the community, the OSINT actual platforms does not wish to expose themselves to CP fight, the few foundation and organization fighting CP are under law enforcement monitoring, Interpol and Europol stays mostly quiet to CP investigators.

# The solution
To develop a Framework along with the needed documentations and processes for CP investigator to report they investigation and cover themselves through a transparency and investigation logs.
CP investigator are condemend to move in the black zone, this project pretend to open a gate so we all can move to the grey zone together and find a place to gang up all together and start working as teams. 

# External actors and Law enforcement
